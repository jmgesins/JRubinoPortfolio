            <h2>Professional Summary &amp; the Road to Grand Circus</h2>
                <p>After graduating with a Bachelor's of English from Oakland University in 2008, I began working at a digital marketing agency in Rochester, Michigan. Initially, my tasks included writing and editing copy for websites, eventually evolving into on and off-page SEO. 
                </p>
                <p>In 2010, I re-located to Chicago with my husband for a few months while continuing to freelance for companies as a digital marketer. Upon my return to Michigan, I continued working as a digital marketer for a few different companies, including a B2B company and a flooring retail store.</p>
                <p>Today, I work as a digital marketer at an indirect auto finance company located in Southfield, Michigan. As my responsibilities within the digital marketing field evolve, I find myself needing more and more programming knowledge. In 2016, with my manager's blessing, I enrolled in the Grand Circus Bootcamp.</p> 
                <p>Let the fun begin!</p>
